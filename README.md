üöÄ Features
Advanced Bypass Techniques
Multiple encoding methods: URL encoding, double encoding, Unicode encoding

Path normalization tests: Relative path traversal (../), absolute path testing

Case variation: Mixed case, lowercase, uppercase paths

Special character injection: Null bytes, special delimiters

Comprehensive Testing
Admin interface discovery: Common administrative paths

Sensitive file detection: Configuration files, backups, logs

Authentication bypass: Testing unprotected directories

Technology-specific tests: Payloads tailored for different platforms

Intelligent Detection
Response analysis: Status code, content length, and content analysis

False positive reduction: Smart filtering of irrelevant responses

Vulnerability signatures: Pattern matching for common vulnerabilities

Performance Optimized
Multithreaded execution: Fast scanning with configurable threads

Session persistence: Maintains cookies and headers between requests

Rate limiting: Respectful scanning with configurable delays

üéØ Usage
Basic Syntax
bash
python3 bypass_tool.py <target_url> [options]
Common Options
text
Options:
  -w WORDLIST     Specify custom wordlist
  -t THREADS      Set number of threads (default: 20)
  -o OUTPUT       Custom output directory
  --deep          Enable deep scanning mode

Example Commands
bash
# Basic scan
python3 bypass_tool.py https://example.com/admin

# With custom wordlist and threads
python3 bypass_tool.py https://test.com -w paths.txt -t 30

# Deep scan with verbose output
python3 bypass_tool.py https://target.com/api --deep --verbose
üîç Methodology
Testing Approach
Initial Reconnaissance

Identify server technologies

Detect web application firewall (WAF) presence

Analyze normal response patterns

Path Fuzzing

Test common administrative paths

Check for sensitive files

Attempt various bypass techniques

Vulnerability Verification

Validate potential findings

Eliminate false positives

Categorize discovered issues

Bypass Techniques
Path Traversal: ../ sequences, encoded variations

Case Manipulation: AdMiN vs admin

Parameter Pollution: Multiple parameters with same name

HTTP Method Switching: GET vs POST vs HEAD

Header Injection: Special headers to bypass controls

üìä Reports
